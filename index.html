							<h3>Determining Your Size</h3>
							<p>The starting point for businesses to understand the Affordable Care Act is figuring out their size. The new law includes two sets of rules: one for large businesses and another for small businesses. This guide includes advice for businesses that fall into the large employer category. An additional guide for small businesses will be issued separately.</p>

							<h3>Are you a large employer?</h3>
							<p>Here’s a quick way to tell if you fall into the large employer category. If you do, you can follow the links in the following chart to get more information about the requirements, penalties, taxes, fees and notifications that apply to large employers.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="page sect-0 pg-h">
							<!-- TODO -->
						</div>

						<div class="page sect-0 pg-i">
							<h3>How To Determine Your Size</h3>
							<p>First things first. If you have 50 or more full-time employees, you fit into the large business category and are subject to the provisions, penalties, taxes and fee, and notifications for large employers.</p>
							<p>A large employer is one that has at least 50 full-time employees or a combination of part-time employees that are equivalent to 50 based upon the hours of service for all employees.</p>

							<p><strong>Full-time Employee:</strong> Under the ACA, a full-time employee is one that worked on average at least 30 hours a week. Another way of defining full-time employee under the ACA is an employee that averages 130 hours of service in a calendar month.</p>

							<p><strong>Full-time Equivalent Employee (FTE):</strong> To figure out how many full-time equivalent employees a company has, add the hours worked by all part-time employees and divide that number by 120. For example: a company has 36 part-time workers that work an average of 100 hours a week, which translates to an additional 30 FTWs for that company. (36 part-time workers x 100 hours &divide; 120 = 30 FTEs). If your company has special circumstances, you should consult your tax advisor.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="page sect-0 pg-j">
							<h3>Grandfathered Plans</h3>
							<p>When the ACA was passed, the government promised Americans they could keep their current healthcare plan if they were happy with it. Thus the ACA “grandfathered” plans that were in effect on March 23, 2010 (the day the law went into effect) to allow them to keep the plans and benefits they already had. This provision mostly affects people in large group plans.</p>
							<p>Grandfathered plans do not have to comply with all of the provisions of the ACA, but they must provide certain benefits to their members if they were not already in place.</p>

							<p>The patients’ rights that must be included in any grandfathered plan include:
								<ul>
									<li>No lifetime limits on coverage and no annual dollar amount restrictions</li>
									<li>No recission of coverage if people accidentally made a mistake on an applications</li>
									<li>Extension of parents’ coverage to include young adults under the age of 26</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>However, those existing plans cannot make certain changes including:
								<ul>
									<li>Eliminating or reducing benefits</li>
									<li>Increasing cost-sharing</li>
									<li>Reducing the employer contribution toward the premium</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>If a plan makes one of those changes, it must also comply with other provisions of the ACA</p>

							<h2>Overview Of The ACA</h2>
							<h3>What the ACA means to Large Employers</h3>

							<p>The Affordable Care Act is changing the world of health insurance both for large employers and for the healthcare marketplace in general.</p>
							<p>This section is a big-picture overview of those changes, with specific details about how the new healthcare arena impacts large employers.</p>

							<span class="blue-button one-line big">Ask Blue KC</span>

							<small class="page-num">Page 1</small>
						</div>

						<div class="page sect-1 pg-2">
							<h3>How Health Insurance Coverage is Changing</h3>
							<p>The Affordable Care Act established what it calls a shared responsibility for federal and state governments, insurers, employers, and individuals to improve the availability, quality and affordability of health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2014, each individual in the United States has a shared responsibility as well to get basic health insurance, or minimum essential coverage.</p>
							<strong class="blue">Each individual is now responsible for getting basic healthcare coverage (minimum essential coverage).</strong>
							<p>The ACA requires each individual in the United States to obtain basic health coverage (minimal essential coverage) as part of the individual’s shared responsibility for healthcare. An individual may obtain that coverage from a variety of sources. In some cases, an individual can apply for an exemption or make a shared responsibility payment to the IRS when filing federal taxes.</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Basic health coverage required for each individual:</h4><br/>
								It is the responsibility of employees and all Americans to obtain some sort of health coverage.They can get the type of coverage that best meets their needs, including:
								<ul>
									<li>Coverage under a federal program such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and certain types of veterans’ coverage</li>
									<li>Coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan, including COBRA and retirement coverage</li>
									<li>Coverage purchased in the individual marketplace</li>
									<li>Coverage under a grandfathered health plan</li>
									<li>Other coverage recognized by HHS as meeting minimum essential coverage requirements</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<small class="page-num">Page 2</small>
						</div>

						<div class="page sect-1 pg-3">
							<p><strong>Minimum Essential Coverage:</strong> The type of coverage an individual needs to have to meet the individual responsibility requirement under the Affordable Care Act. This includes individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP,TRICARE and certain other coverage.</p>
							<p><strong>Exemptions:</strong> Some individuals are exempt from the individual minimum coverage requirements. These include: certain religious sects; nonresidents of the United States; people in jail; those who cannot afford coverage; members of Indian tribes; taxpayers below the income tax filing threshold; and people with short coverage gaps of up to three months.</p>
							<p><strong>Shared Responsibility Payment:</strong> Individuals who fail to get coverage or qualify for an exemption are required to file a shared responsibility payment when they file their individual income tax return.</p>
							<p><strong>Dependents:</strong> A taxpayer also has responsibility for his or her dependents in some cases. The ACA uses the IRS definition of a dependent. If the dependent could be claimed under IRS rules, whether or not the dependent was actually claimed, the taxpayer has responsibility for providing minimum essential coverage. Married couples who file jointly are jointly responsible for any shared responsibility payment.</p>
							<p><strong>Penalties:</strong> Penalties apply to individuals who do not provide minimal essential coverage for themselves or their dependents.</p>

							<div class="box">
								<p><strong>STARTING DATE: 2014</strong></p>
								<p><strong>What You Should Do:</strong> If you offer qualified coverage, it is the responsibility of your employees to make sure they obtain minimum essential coverage.</p>
							</div>

							<small class="page-num">Page 3</small>
						</div>

						<div class="page sect-1 pg-4">
							<div class="box">
								<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong> Proposed rules for individual minimum coverage have been issued by both theTreasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.They are seeking comments on these proposals until May of 2013. Check back with us for updates about the final rules.</p>
							</div>
							<p class="blue">Health insurance exchanges are being developed in each state to offer individuals and small employers affordable care.</p>
							<p>The ACA also provides for state-based health insurance exchanges, or online marketplaces, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage. Each state has the option of operating its own exchange or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange. If a state doesn’t choose to do either, it will become part of a federally-facilitated exchange.The exchanges are in the process of becoming operational by October 1, 2013. Missouri and Kansas did not signal their intention to set up an exchange or partner with the federal government, so both states have defaulted to become part of the federal exchange.</p>
							<p><strong>Online Consumer Marketplace:</strong> By October 1 of 2013, each state is required to have an exchange set up to sell coverage to individuals and small employers.The exchanges are meant to allow consumers to compare prices on standardized policies.</p>
							<p><strong>Kansas And Missouri:</strong> Both states have decided not to offer their own healthcare exchange, so their exchanges will be operated by the federal government.</p>
							<p><strong>Penalties For Large Employers:</strong> The ACA provides for penalties against employers if a certain number of their employees choose to buy insurance from the state exchange rather than using the employer-sponsored plan.</p>

							<small class="page-num">Page 4</small>
						</div>

						<div class="page sect-1 pg-5">
							<strong>Exchange Notification Requirements:</strong> Employers will be required to inform eligible employees of the health insurance exchange offered in the state and the availability of the premium tax credit.The notification must include an exchange service description, subsidy availability in the event an affordable, minimum-value plan is not offered, and premium/ tax implications of purchasing on the exchange. However, the requirement will not go into effect until regulations are issued.
							<strong>Actuarial Value (AV):</strong>The act designates creates four tiers of health plans available for purchase through the Exchanges. Each tier is defined by its actuarial value, or percent paid by
							a health plan of the percentage of the total allowed costs of benefits.They include the following levels:
							<ul>
								<li>Bronze health plan is a health plan that has an AV of 60 percent</li>
								<li>Silver health plan has an AV of 70 percent</li>
								<li>Gold health plan has an AV of 80 percent</li>
								<li>Platinum health plan has as an AV of 90 percent. The value may vary by plus or minus 2 percent.</li>
							</ul>

							<div class="box">
								<p><strong>STARTING DATE: OCTOBER 1, 2013</strong></p>
								<p><strong>What Should You Do:</strong> Prepare for the notification requirements by monitoring this document for updates.</p>
								<p><strong>What’s Ahead:</strong>The exchanges are supposed to be working by October 1, 2013.</p>
								<p><strong>How Blue KC Can Help:</strong> We will keep you up to date on the exchange notification and help you comply with its provisions.</p>
